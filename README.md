## Description
This is a fork of an R package incorporating a set of functions for computing potential evapotranspiration and several widely used drought indices including the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI).

All credit for the original code should go to the original authors.


## Goals
- ~~Add formal unit testing with testthat~~
- ~~Move documentation over to roxygen~~
- ~~Transition dependencies to imports~~
- ~~Transition data to data-raw and use rda data~~
- ~~Speed up the L-moments calculations (where possible)~~
- ~~Make general performance improvements~~
- Remove pglo.R and update documentation
- Add parallel processing support
- Increase test coverage to 75%
- Increase test coverage to 90%
- Figure out how to get the accented letters back without upsetting travis-ci
