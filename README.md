## Description
This is a fork of an R package incorporating a set of functions for computing potential evapotranspiration and several widely used drought indices including the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI).

All credit for the original code should go to the original authors.


## Goals
- Add formal unit testing with testthat
- Move documentation over to roxygen
- Speed up the L-moments calculations (where possible)
- Make general performance improvements (where possible)
- Add parallel processing support
